The Geometric Principles of Artificial Intelligence
Abstract
The process of thinking and the essence of knowledge are products of external objects entering the human brain through sensory organs and being processed by thought. By studying the essential structure of knowledge, one can grasp the thinking process of the human brain. After external objects enter the brain through the senses, the brain processes them through thought; that is, the brain projects its own information-processing principles, characteristics, and laws onto those objects. Therefore, as products of brain activity, knowledge necessarily contains and reflects the principles, characteristics, and laws by which the brain processes information. Consequently, through an in-depth study of knowledge, one can grasp the nature of human thinking.

Introduction
This paper begins with the study of knowledge itself. From the perspective of the ten major conceptual categories, it examines the structure of knowledge and further reveals the central status of nouns within the structure of knowledge, thereby discovering the fundamental structural elements of knowledge. Next, from the standpoint of the significance, laws, and principles of knowledge construction, it explores the essence of knowledge.
Using the results of this study on knowledge, the paper infers the basic characteristics, principles, and laws of brain thinking, and on this basis proposes fundamental conjectures regarding the thinking process of the brain. These conjectures describe, to a certain extent, the entire process of thinking: starting from terminal external objects, passing through sensory organs into the brain, proceeding to storage and memory patterns within the brain, and extending all the way to the construction of basic four-dimensional infrastructure, and even to the complete thinking process as a whole.

**Chapter One
The Structure of Knowledge**
Knowledge is the product of brain-based cognitive processing. Therefore, analyzing the structure and composition of knowledge is equivalent to analyzing the structure and composition of thought. Language is the instrumental shell of thinking; thus, we may begin by analyzing language in order to analyze knowledge.
In fact, speaking, thinking, and writing all depend on language. As long as one grasps the overall landscape of language—this vast and rich ocean—one may lift a corner of the veil concealing the mystery of knowledge. The approach to language adopted here is not limited to grammar or lexicology, nor is it confined to the superficial notion of language as merely a “tool and shell” of thought. Rather, it concerns the underlying cognitive structures and knowledge content behind linguistic signs and correspondences.
This approach draws upon achievements in grammar and lexicology, including their classification systems, criteria, principles, and associated ideas. Although these achievements are constrained by the epistemological limitations of their time and may not fully or fundamentally capture the essence of thought and knowledge, they nevertheless contain elements that correctly reflect and embody that essence. While the essence of thought and knowledge is indeed profound and abstract and difficult to apprehend in its entirety, it can nevertheless be grasped to a certain degree through its external symbolic instruments—language. Thought and knowledge must necessarily manifest themselves through language, and therefore language provides access to correct insights into the essence of knowledge and thought, including those embodied in grammatical and lexical findings.
Grammar and lexicology capture only certain aspects and levels of language. This paper seeks to open a new domain for a more comprehensive and concrete grasp of language. The discussion proceeds along this new direction.
Language is composed of concepts, which are the most basic semantic units. If language is the tool and shell of thought, then concepts are the most basic components of that tool and shell. If the entirety of thought is compared to a living organism, then concepts are the cells composing that organism. All activities of the organism must be explained and supported by its cells; likewise, the entire thinking process must be explained and supported by its fundamental units—concepts. In this sense, the essence of thinking is the essence of concepts.

**Section One
The Structure of the Ten Conceptual Categories**
Modern lexicology divides concepts into ten major categories. This classification system and its criteria reflect, in a direct and intuitive manner, the categories and characteristics of the cognitive content denoted by linguistic signs. This represents not only an important achievement in linguistic research, but also a significant achievement in the study of thought itself, providing an essential foundation for further investigation into essence.
The ten conceptual categories include: nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, numerals, classifiers (measure words), pronouns, particles, and adverbs. Each will be examined in turn.
________________________________________
I. Nouns
(1) The Division of A-Type and B-Type Nouns
Among all conceptual systems, nouns occupy the largest proportion quantitatively. Surveying the entire lexical-conceptual world, one finds that the overwhelming majority are nouns—from flowers and trees to boundless nebulae, from simple phenomena and objects to abstract and profound human mental activities. None exist without nouns.
What, then, is the essence of nouns? What is their mathematical definition? What are their foundational origins and hierarchical levels?
I hold that all concepts are constructed step by step upon the most basic external natural scenes; no concept can exist abstractly, detached from external natural imagery. Based on this, within the vast ocean of noun concepts, one readily finds concepts such as “grass,” “egg,” “tree,” and “pen.” These concepts possess concrete, corresponding existence within external scenes. They are the only type of concepts in the world with this property.
Strictly speaking, all other conceptual systems—including other types of nouns—can be regarded as constructed or alienated existences based upon these. The noun concepts closest to them are those denoting continuous motion within external scenes, such as “breathing,” “whirlwind,” “tide,” “earthquake,” “eating,” and “heavy rain.”
We shall call the former A-type concepts and the latter B-type concepts.
(2) Nouns and Verbs
We temporarily suspend the analysis of nouns here, because they are intertwined with verbs, and thus turn briefly to the study of verbs.
Verbs denote the motion of objects; in a broad sense, they denote all changes of things and phenomena in the world. Here, I examine verbs from this most fundamental level of meaning. In essence, they correspond to B-type concepts. The difference lies in that B-type concepts grasp and denote an entire moving object or process as an organic whole, whereas verbs emphasize only the ongoing nature, variability, and immediacy of motion itself.
Thus, the two share the same essence but differ in descriptive emphasis. Consequently, concepts such as “running,” “movement,” “attending school,” and “illumination” may assume different roles in different contexts.
In fact, any verb concept can be treated as a B-type concept. Therefore, we subsume verb concepts into the B-type category. In the subsequent study of conceptual categories, verbs will no longer appear independently. This conversion and consolidation are equivalent and correct from a research perspective.
________________________________________
(3) The Division of C-Type and D-Type Nouns
Having already extracted A-type and B-type concepts from the noun system based on their relationship to external scenes, we note that both intuitive understanding and future research practice will demonstrate that this basic sequence constitutes the foundation of all other conceptual worlds, and even of the entire, elusive edifice of human civilization.
Let us now examine other noun concepts more closely. We find roughly two additional systems:
I. Concepts of direction, orientation, structure, composition, position, shape, east, west, relations, and so forth.
II. Concepts of chemical properties, physical properties, force, function, effect, connection, mechanism, physiology, and similar notions.
Upon analysis, it becomes clear that the first category concerns the description of static scenes, while the second concerns the description of dynamic scenes. Like the B-type system, neither has a direct corresponding existence in external scenes.
How, then, are their essence, reality, and strict mathematical relationship to scenes to be understood?
Human civilization feels abstract and difficult to grasp precisely because, in the construction of concepts, certain issues remain unclear, incomplete, and insufficiently resolved. Over time, these accumulate and form an apparently alienated and seemingly unshakeable barrier.
Have these two systems, constructed on the basis of scenes, now exceeded naive cognition and mathematical comprehensibility, becoming black holes of alienation?
This question will be addressed later in dedicated analysis. For now, I designate these two systems as the C-type system (Category I) and the D-type system (Category II). They can only be defined as concepts about corresponding A-type and B-type concepts.
Although our understanding of these four systems remains incomplete at this stage, the entire ocean of noun concepts may be divided into these four categories. A unified definition of the essence of nouns will be developed later.
________________________________________
II. Adjectives
Adjectives are relatively few in number, yet they occupy a crucial—almost central—position in thought.
Adjectives describe the tendency or state of an object or phenomenon with respect to a certain aspect or criterion; they are comparative concepts. Adjectives may be divided into two major classes:
1.	Relatively simple, clear, and computable adjectives, such as “large,” “long,” and “thin.”
2.	More complex and abstract adjectives, such as “beautiful,” “unified,” “harmonious,” “absolute,” and “vast.”
Let us first consider the simple class. These are scalar concepts possessing opposing poles. That is, with respect to a referenced “aspect” or “criterion,” they exhibit tendencies of increase or decrease. The notions of “dependence/reference” and “aspect/criterion” are the two most fundamental components of this definition and must coexist.
For example, “large” depends on and refers to “volume.” Here, “volume” is the “aspect/criterion” in the adjective’s definition. Crucially, this aspect must be a noun, and specifically a C-type or D-type noun. This point must be emphasized.
“Dependence” and “reference” indicate that adjectives must be grounded in C-type and D-type nouns.
What, then, is the adjective itself? What is its independent reality or life? If one attempts to isolate it completely from its underlying basis, it becomes abstract and fragmented. This negative result confirms that the full meaning and existence of adjectives must be sought in the C-type and D-type nouns upon which they are based.
The definition already provides the direction: scalarity and polarity. Scalarity refers to continuity, quantitative variation, and commonality. In other words, one must discover continuity, gradation, and commonality within the referenced “aspect or criterion.”
Thus, the existential meaning of adjectives is not external to nouns but rather represents a more intrinsic layer of meaning within C-type and D-type nouns. In this sense, the essence of adjectives is even more fundamentally the essence of nouns.
The same analysis applies to complex adjectives. Their complexity arises solely because the referenced “aspect or criterion” is highly abstract and difficult to grasp.
“Beauty” may be regarded as the highest life-form of adjectives. Its criteria are difficult to describe precisely and can only be loosely characterized as symmetry, orderly structure, fluency of mechanism, or rhythmic coherence. Yet it, too, represents a deeper intrinsic meaning of the noun system itself—indeed, an evolutionary growth of human civilization toward higher-order structures and rules.
An apparent contradiction arises between lower-level and higher-level adjectives. Consider “large”: it compares two objects with respect to volume, which is a shared property, while “large” itself emphasizes difference, opposition, and individuality.
By contrast, higher-level adjectives such as “beautiful” often allow us to say that both object A and object B are beautiful, merging them conceptually rather than emphasizing comparison or opposition. The scalar and comparative awareness seems to disappear, transforming “beauty” into a common, connective attribute.
Why does this occur?
The answer lies again in the definition. Adjectives depend on and reference certain aspects or criteria. The comparative and scalar nature is fixed, but adjectives vary as nouns vary. When nouns are simple, their content serves as an obvious shared attribute, and the comparative rule highlights difference. When nouns become complex, their content embodies rich commonality, and the same comparative rule instead reflects connection and unity.
This is the root of the phenomenon.
________________________________________
III. Other Concepts
Adverbs are essentially subordinate to adjectives; they represent a further sequencing and higher-level structuring of adjectives.
Numerals denote the quantity or number of objects. How did numerical awareness arise in human civilization? Today even elementary students understand numbers so thoroughly that their mystery and latent beauty are often ignored. Through capitalization, fixation, and secularization, numbers have been stripped of their soul, leaving only a crude shell.
If, however, one attempts to rediscover their meaning and true life through fresh, concrete external scenes, their abstract nature gradually emerges.
Originally, each number corresponded to a concrete scene, not to an abstract, computable entity. One object, two identical objects, many identical objects—each stage embeds the germ of numerical awareness. A single object exists simply; two identical objects introduce sequence, commonality, and relational space; many identical objects further amplify this. Within these gaps, new civilizational sprouts emerge.
Classifiers denote units of objects: a leaf, an aircraft, a person, a group, a bowl of soup, a bottle of wine. They assist numerals in modifying nouns and derive from form, quantity, or conceptual criteria. The most abstract classifier is “one unit,” which expresses singular existence and represents the abstraction of all classifiers.
Prepositions indicate relational frameworks—range, condition, or affiliation—between two concepts. They do not constitute the relation itself but rather serve as mediating substrates abstracted from concrete relational nouns.
Conjunctions express connection. Whether passive (mere coexistence) or active (causal linkage), such connections exist objectively and derive meaning solely from the connected entities themselves.
Pronouns denote substitution, enabling indirect reference and sequential cognitive economy.
Particles assist sentence structure and modality. Though often dismissed as auxiliary, their true significance will emerge through deeper analysis of sentence structure and modality.
**Section Two
An Overall Description of the Structure of Noun Conceptual Categories**
After dividing nouns into A-type, B-type, C-type, and D-type systems, we can now examine the overall structural characteristics of noun concepts.
First, from the perspective of external scenes, A-type concepts correspond directly to static objects or entities in natural scenes, while B-type concepts correspond to dynamic processes occurring within such scenes. C-type and D-type concepts, by contrast, do not directly correspond to independent external objects or processes; rather, they describe structure, relations, mechanisms, properties, and effects abstracted from A-type and B-type concepts.
This layered structure already implies a directional progression: from concrete to abstract, from direct depiction to relational construction, from visible objects to invisible laws.
However, it must be emphasized that this is not a linear progression but a nested and interdependent structure. C-type and D-type concepts do not float freely above A-type and B-type concepts; they are rooted in them and cannot exist independently. Any attempt to sever this foundation results in conceptual alienation and abstraction without substance.
From a mathematical standpoint, A-type and B-type concepts constitute the base domain, while C-type and D-type concepts form higher-order mappings defined upon that domain.
________________________________________
(1) The Central Status of Nouns
Among all conceptual categories, nouns occupy a central and dominant position. This is not merely a matter of quantity but of structural necessity.
All other conceptual categories—verbs, adjectives, numerals, classifiers, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, particles, and adverbs—either describe, modify, connect, reference, or operate upon nouns. Without nouns, none of these categories can maintain independent meaning.
In this sense, nouns form the skeletal framework of knowledge, while other concepts function as connective tissues, regulatory mechanisms, and dynamic modifiers. Any complete understanding of knowledge must therefore begin with nouns and return to nouns.
This centrality explains why the study of nouns leads directly into the study of knowledge itself, and ultimately into the study of thinking.
________________________________________
(2) Static Scenes, Dynamic Scenes, and Concept Construction
The human brain does not process the world as an undifferentiated flow. Instead, it segments reality into scenes.
A static scene consists of relatively stable objects coexisting in space. A dynamic scene consists of changes, motions, and interactions unfolding over time.
A-type nouns arise from the brain’s recognition of static scenes. B-type nouns arise from its recognition of dynamic scenes. C-type and D-type nouns arise from the brain’s attempt to extract invariant structures, relations, and mechanisms from repeated exposure to similar static and dynamic scenes.
This extraction process is not arbitrary. It follows strict internal rules that will be examined later. For now, it suffices to note that concept construction is fundamentally scene-based.
________________________________________
**Section Three
Between-Elements and the Structure of Scenes**
We now arrive at a core concept of this paper: between-elements.
When the brain perceives a scene, it does not merely register isolated objects. Rather, it perceives relationships, intervals, and connections between objects. These relational components are what I term between-elements.
Between-elements are not objects themselves; they do not exist independently in the external world. Yet they are indispensable for the construction of knowledge. Without between-elements, objects would remain isolated and unintelligible.
For example, in a scene containing two objects, the brain automatically constructs notions such as distance, orientation, relative size, alignment, and sequence. These notions are not additional objects but relational structures emerging between objects.
Thus, between-elements are the fundamental carriers of relational meaning.
________________________________________
(1) Horizontal Between-Elements
Horizontal between-elements arise between objects coexisting within the same scene or at the same level.
Examples include spatial distance, alignment, parallelism, symmetry, proportion, and relative position. These between-elements form the basis of geometry, visual perception, and structural cognition.
Horizontal between-elements are primarily responsible for the construction of C-type noun systems, such as structure, form, position, and relation.
________________________________________
(2) Vertical Between-Elements
Vertical between-elements arise across different scenes, times, or layers.
When the brain compares multiple similar scenes across time, it extracts invariant patterns and regularities. These extracted regularities form vertical between-elements.
Examples include causality, mechanism, function, force, and law. Vertical between-elements underlie the construction of D-type noun systems.
In essence, vertical between-elements represent the brain’s ability to compress temporal and experiential complexity into stable conceptual structures.
________________________________________
(3) The Generative Role of Between-Elements
Between-elements are generative. They give rise to new concepts, new structures, and higher-order abstractions.
Once between-elements are stabilized and symbolized, they can themselves become objects of thought, leading to further layers of conceptual construction. This recursive process drives the expansion of knowledge and the evolution of civilization.
Importantly, this generative process follows internal constraints. Not all conceivable between-elements can be formed; only those that satisfy certain conditions of stability, commonality, and repeatability are retained.
These conditions will be analyzed in subsequent sections.
________________________________________
**Section Four
The Five Major Noun Systems**
Based on the nature of between-elements, D-type nouns may be further divided into five major systems:
1.	Chemical system – describing transformations and interactions at the material level.
2.	Physical system – describing forces, motion, and energy.
3.	Mechanical system – describing structural mechanisms and functional transmission.
4.	Information system – describing signals, encoding, and communication.
5.	Principle system – describing abstract rules, laws, and governing patterns.
These systems do not exist independently. They overlap, interpenetrate, and support one another, forming a complex but coherent conceptual network.
**Section Five
The Commonality of Knowledge**
The construction of knowledge is not arbitrary. Although the surface forms of knowledge appear diverse and fragmented, their internal structures exhibit a high degree of commonality.
What is meant by commonality?
Commonality refers to the shared structural elements, relational patterns, and organizational principles that exist across different knowledge domains, different conceptual systems, and different levels of abstraction. It is not superficial similarity, but deep structural correspondence.
The existence of commonality is not a philosophical assumption; it is an inevitable consequence of the way the brain processes information.
________________________________________
(1) The Source of Commonality
All knowledge originates from external scenes entering the brain through sensory organs. Although the content of scenes varies infinitely, the brain itself is finite and structurally constrained.
Therefore, the brain must process diverse inputs using a limited set of internal mechanisms. These mechanisms impose uniformity on otherwise heterogeneous experiences.
Between-elements play a decisive role here. Because between-elements are extracted through repeated comparison of scenes, only those relational structures that are stable, repeatable, and compressible can survive. These surviving structures constitute the common core of knowledge.
Thus, commonality is the residue left after variability is filtered out.
________________________________________
(2) Levels of Commonality
Commonality exists at multiple levels.
At the lowest level, there is perceptual commonality: shapes, distances, movements, and alignments recur across scenes.
At higher levels, there is structural commonality: mechanisms, causal chains, functional relationships, and systemic organization recur across domains.
At the highest level, there is principled commonality: abstract rules, laws, and patterns that govern entire classes of phenomena.
Each higher level of commonality is constructed upon the stabilization of lower-level between-elements.
________________________________________
(3) Commonality and Knowledge Compression
Knowledge is, in essence, compression.
The brain cannot store every scene in its entirety. Instead, it stores compressed representations that preserve essential relations while discarding irrelevant detail.
Commonality enables this compression. By identifying shared structures across scenes, the brain reduces storage cost and increases predictive power.
This is why highly abstract knowledge—such as physical laws or mathematical principles—can possess extraordinary explanatory power despite their simplicity.
________________________________________
**Section Six
Parallel Patterns**
From commonality emerges another fundamental phenomenon: parallel patterns.
Parallel patterns refer to the recurrence of similar structural configurations across different domains, scales, or contexts.
For example, branching structures appear in trees, rivers, blood vessels, and organizational hierarchies. Oscillatory patterns appear in mechanical systems, biological rhythms, and economic cycles.
These parallels are not coincidences. They arise because different systems are constructed using the same limited set of between-elements and organizational principles.
________________________________________
(1) The Geometry of Parallelism
Parallel patterns often manifest geometrically.
Geometric relations—such as symmetry, parallelism, proportionality, and continuity—provide the most efficient carriers of commonality. Geometry, therefore, occupies a privileged position in cognition.
This is why geometric intuition plays such a powerful role in scientific discovery and why abstract knowledge often finds its most natural expression in geometric form.
________________________________________
(2) Vertical and Horizontal Parallelism
Parallelism operates both horizontally and vertically.
Horizontal parallelism refers to structural similarity between different systems at the same level, such as different mechanical devices sharing the same transmission principles.
Vertical parallelism refers to structural similarity across levels, such as the correspondence between microscopic physical laws and macroscopic phenomena.
Both forms of parallelism arise from the reuse of stabilized between-elements.
________________________________________
**Section Seven
Toward a Universal Gravitation of Knowledge**
We are now in a position to introduce a central conjecture of this paper: the universal gravitation of knowledge.
Just as physical objects exert gravitational attraction due to mass, knowledge structures exert mutual attraction due to commonality.
Concepts that share strong commonality tend to cluster, connect, and integrate. Over time, this attraction leads to the formation of coherent knowledge systems, disciplines, and worldviews.
This process is not conscious or intentional; it is an emergent property of the brain’s information-processing architecture.
________________________________________
(1) Knowledge Attraction and Integration
When two concepts share between-elements, the cognitive cost of linking them is low. As a result, the brain naturally integrates them.
Conversely, concepts with little or no commonality remain isolated and difficult to connect.
This explains why interdisciplinary integration occurs naturally in some areas but faces resistance in others.
________________________________________
(2) Knowledge Orbits and Stability
Highly abstract principles function like massive bodies in knowledge space. They attract numerous lower-level concepts into stable orbits.
Scientific laws, mathematical frameworks, and foundational theories occupy such positions. Their stability arises from maximal commonality across vast domains.
________________________________________
**Section Eight
The Geometric Nature of Thinking**
From the above analysis, a fundamental conclusion emerges: thinking is geometric in nature.
This does not mean that all thinking involves explicit geometry, but that the underlying structures of thought—relations, distances, alignments, and patterns—are fundamentally geometric.
Between-elements constitute the coordinates of thought. Commonality defines distances. Parallel patterns define directions. Universal gravitation defines attraction.
Together, these elements form a cognitive geometry.
________________________________________
(1) Four-Dimensional Cognitive Infrastructure
The brain constructs a four-dimensional infrastructure of thought, integrating space, time, structure, and relation.
External scenes are projected into this infrastructure, transformed, compressed, and reorganized. Thought unfolds within it.
________________________________________
(2) Implications for Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, if it is to approach genuine understanding, must replicate not only surface behaviors but this geometric infrastructure of thought.
Merely increasing computational power or data volume cannot substitute for the construction of between-elements, commonality extraction, and geometric organization.
The future of artificial intelligence lies in geometry.
Conclusion
Through an analysis of the structure of knowledge, this paper has attempted to reveal the fundamental principles governing human thinking.
By examining conceptual categories—especially the central role of nouns—and by introducing the framework of A-type, B-type, C-type, and D-type concepts, the study establishes that all knowledge is constructed upon external scenes and their internal relational structures.
The introduction of between-elements provides a unifying explanation for how relations, mechanisms, and laws emerge from concrete experience. Between-elements are not secondary or derivative; they are the essential generative components of cognition. Without them, neither abstraction nor understanding is possible.
On this basis, the concept of commonality explains why knowledge can be compressed, transferred, and expanded. Commonality is the structural residue of repeated experience filtered through the constraints of the brain. It is the reason why different domains of knowledge can resonate, integrate, and reinforce one another.
From commonality arises parallel patterns, which reveal the deep structural unity of diverse phenomena. These patterns are not imposed by human imagination but are discovered through the reuse of stabilized relational structures.
The conjecture of a universal gravitation of knowledge further explains the spontaneous organization of concepts into coherent systems. Knowledge does not accumulate randomly; it self-organizes according to intrinsic attractions determined by shared structure.
All these findings converge on a single conclusion: thinking is fundamentally geometric. The brain constructs a geometric infrastructure in which objects, relations, patterns, and laws are positioned, connected, and transformed.
This perspective has direct implications for artificial intelligence. True intelligence cannot arise solely from statistical correlation or brute-force computation. Without the construction of between-elements, the extraction of commonality, and the formation of geometric cognitive space, artificial systems remain fundamentally limited.
Only by embracing the geometric principles underlying human cognition can artificial intelligence move beyond imitation toward genuine understanding.
